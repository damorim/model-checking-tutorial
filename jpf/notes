What JPF is?
- Depends on how you configure it. Basically, the JPF "Core" module is a custom VM for Java.
  It is used to find defects in the programs generating a report for further analysis.

Notes: Since the JPF explores systematically **all possible executions**, this means that
       JPF number of paths can (and possibly will) grow exponentially. Typical choices are different
       scheduling sequences or random values.

First, JPF executes the program to find all possible ways to find defects, and then, explains
you what caused those defects.

JPF vs Testing
While Testing takes only one path in consideration, which is the path defined by the developer, or by the tool,
JPF does not define that path. As said before, it explores **all possible** paths.

==== CAVEATS ====
- JPF is not a lightweight tool
