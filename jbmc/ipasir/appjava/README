This is an example of using an ipasir compatible SAT 
solver (Picosat960) in a Java application.

The ipasir4j folder contains a Java version of the ipasir
interface and c++ JNI glue code to connect it with ipasir.
This part of the code is reusable without modification for
any Java application. However, it requires modifications
of the first part of build.sh if you wish to use another 
ipasir solver.

The ipasir4jEssentials folder contains a simple Java
application using the ipasir4j interface. In order to
build and run this application first build ipasir4j.
