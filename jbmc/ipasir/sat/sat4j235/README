This "glue" code for connecting Sat4j with ipasir has two parts:
- the java part: Sat4jIpasir.java
- the c++ part: ipasirsat4jglue.cpp

The java part impements an ipasir like interface using sat4j calls.
Except for the interruption functionality all the methods correspond
to the ipasir definitions. There is a unit test (Sat4jIpasirTest.java)
for this part.

The c++ part deals with the technicalities of calling java methods
from a native application using the JNI technology. For most of the
methods there is a corresponding Java method to call. The exception
is the interruption functionality. Ipasir uses callbacks and the
java part uses a direct interrupt function. Therefore the c++ part
runs a thread for calling the callback function defined via the
ipasir interface and notifies the java part using its interrupt
method.
