Genipamax is a trivial partial Max-SAT solver 
based on adding activation literals to soft clauses 
and encoding a cardinality constraint on these activation literals.
To encode the cardinality constraint pblib[1] is used.

NOTE: A C++ compiler supporting the std=c++0x flag is required.
The makefiles expect g++-4.7, if you want to use a different compiler
update the 'C++11' file.
